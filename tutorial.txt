 Here is an example board:
     A   B   C   D   E
   +---+---+---+---+---+
 1 | - | - | - | - | - |
   +---+---+---+---+---+
 2 | - | - | - | - | - |

 3 | - | - | - | - | - |

 4 | - | - | - | - | - |

 You play by clearing the field of mines without setting one off.

 To clear a square, input the coordinate.
  EXAMPLE:  B3
 If the square isn't a bomb, then it'll show a number of the ammount of bombs surrounding the square.
 If there isn't an adjacent bomb, the square will be empty and the surrounding squares will be cleared automatically.
 If the square is a bomb, congrats' you lost!

 There are also flaggs to place on the mines so you don't accidentally clear one.
 To place a flag, input the coordinate of the square but with an 'f' before.
  EXAMPLE:  fC4
 A 'P' will show up, representing the flag and you won't be able to accidentally clear it.
 To remove the flag, repeat the earlier step and it will revert back to an uncleared square.

 At any time, when  you want to quit, just type 'save' into the input box.
 The game will stop and your progress will be saved.
 If you type 'load' into the input box, you will be able to pick up from where you left off.

 You can choose the size of the gameboard between [2x2] and [26x26] .
 There are [3] difficulties:  easy, medium and hard with corresponding number of bombs (10%, 20% and 30%, [custom]).

 When setting up the game, just press [enter] to choose the standard settings.
